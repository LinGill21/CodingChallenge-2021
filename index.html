            <h2>Rules</h2>
            <section><p>In coding challenges you are given a 5 problems and each them have a number assocatied with them.</br> That number
                goes with how difficult the problem. 1.0 -1.5 means the problem is easy. 1.5-2.5 means the problem has medium difficultly.</br> 
                In this coding challenge we will not go any higher since we only have an hour.</br>  In the table below you will find the problems
                and their difficulty. Once you finsh a problem submit it to kaddis to run the tests. </br> Once you pass all the tests send me a 
                screenshot of all the tests passing (see example below). I will mark that you did it.
            </p>
            <h3>How to win</h3>
            <p>
                We will use a point based system. The number that assocatied with the problem will be how much a problem is worth.</br> 
                The first team to turn in a problem will get a bonus point.</br> 
                The team with the most points at the end wins. 
            </p>
            <h4>Kaddis Things</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Do not prompt the user for input. The computer knows when to put input in</li>
                <li>Make your output look like the demo output</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Once the contest is over I will be posting solutions if you would like to see them
