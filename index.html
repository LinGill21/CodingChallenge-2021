  <h1>ACM's Coding Challenge</h1>
  <main>
    <article>
      <section>
        <div>
          <h2>Rules</h2>
          <p>In coding challenges you are given <span>5</span> problems and each of the problems have a number
            assocatied with them. That
            number goes with how difficult the problem. <span>1.0 - 1.5</span> means the problem is easy.
            <span>1.5-2.5</span> means the problem is
            medium difficultly.</br><br>
            We will not go any higher in difficulty since we only have an hour. In the table at the bottom of the page,
            you
            will find the problems and their difficulty.
            <br><br> Once you finsh a problem submit it to kaddis to run the tests. After you pass all
            the tests send Lindsay a screenshot of all the tests passing (see example below). We will mark that you did
            it.

        <div>
          <h3>How to win</h3>
          <p>
            We will use a point based system. The number that assocatied with the problem will be how much a problem is
            worth.</br><br>
            The first team to turn in a problem will get a <span>bonus</span> point.</br><br>
            The team with the most points at the end wins.
          </p>

          <h4>Kaddis Things</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Do <span>not</span> prompt the user for input. The computer knows when to put input in</li>
            <li>Make your output look like the demo output</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Once the contest is over I will be posting solutions if you would like to see them
